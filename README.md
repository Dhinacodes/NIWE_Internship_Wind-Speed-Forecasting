NIWE Internship Project

This project focuses on developing a wind speed forecasting system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system utilizes historical meteorological data from the Jafrabad coast (December 2018 - November 2019) to forecast wind speeds. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. Raw data is processed into structured DataFrames using pandas, with missing values handled via moving average and Kalman filter interpolation. The CNN model uses this data to capture patterns and trends for reliable wind speed predictions.

A Streamlit web application was developed for easy data upload and wind speed retrieval. Docker containerization ensures consistency and scalability, while GitHub Actions automate continuous integration and deployment. This project demonstrates the practical use of data science and machine learning in meteorology, offering a valuable tool for industries that depend on accurate weather forecasts.
