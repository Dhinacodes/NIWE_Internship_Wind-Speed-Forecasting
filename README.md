NIWE Internship Project

Wind Speed Forecasting using CNN Model: Building, Deploying and Automation

This project focuses on building a wind speed forecasting system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It utilizes historical meteorological data from the Jafrabad coast (December 2018 - November 2019) to predict wind speeds accurately.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:
Utilizes pandas for structuring data
Handles missing values using moving average and Kalman filter interpolation

Model Development:
Trains a CNN model to capture patterns and trends in wind speed data

Deployment:

Streamlit Application:
Allows easy upload of data and retrieval of forecasted wind speeds

Docker Containerization:
Ensures application consistency and scalability across different environments

GitHub Actions:
Automates continuous integration and deployment processes
